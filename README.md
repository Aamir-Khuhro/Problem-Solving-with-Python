# Problem Solving Repository

Welcome to my **Problem Solving** repository! ðŸš€

This repository is a collection of my solutions to coding problems sourced from platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank, and other coding challenge websites. Whether you're a fellow coder looking for inspiration or someone interested in the problem-solving process, you're in the right place.

## What to Expect

- **Diverse Range of Problems:** Explore a variety of algorithmic and data structure problems. From classic challenges to domain-specific questions, this repository covers a wide spectrum.

- **Clean and Well-Documented Code:** Each solution is crafted with readability and clarity in mind. I believe in the importance of clean code, and you'll find comments explaining the thought process behind each solution.

- **Continuous Learning:** Problem-solving is not just about finding a solution but also about continuous learning. You may find multiple solutions to the same problem, showcasing different approaches and trade-offs.

## How to Navigate

- **Folder Structure:** Problems are organized by platform (e.g., LeetCode, HackerRank) and then categorized by topic or difficulty level. Feel free to explore the folders and discover solutions.

- **File Naming:** Each file is named according to the problem or a descriptive title. File names are designed to be intuitive and reflect the essence of the problem.

## Contribution

While this repository primarily serves as a personal coding journal, contributions are welcome! If you have a unique solution, an optimization, or want to add a new problem, feel free to submit a pull request. Let's learn and grow together!

Happy coding! ðŸš€
